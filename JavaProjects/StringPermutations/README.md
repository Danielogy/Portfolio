Using queues and stacks, this program will find all possible permutations of a given string. It uses a "dictionary.txt" file that contains
all words in the English dictionary. It adds these words to an array list and the inputed strings given by the user is then compared to this
array list. The program displays all the possible permutations of the input and sends it to a "perms.txt" file. The user can also find a 
"analytics.txt" file after the program has finished which contains information about what the user inputed.
