This program uses the "dictionary.txt" file to analyze a text file's spelling. If a word is not found in the dictionary, the program will 
prompt the user to add it to the dictionary file, replace the word, or simply continue if the word is a name, for example. I have given
provided an input file named "inputFile.txt" which can be used, or you can create your own plain .txt file and see how the program works!
